   - **ViewModel** :
     Acts as a mediator between the View and the Model, handling the app's logic and preparing observable data for the View.
  - **View** :
    Displays data and captures user input, updating the UI based on the ViewModel's observable data.

- **Repository Pattern**

  Implements a clean and modular way to handle data operations, ensuring a separation of concerns and making the codebase more maintainable.

  Supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  
  Error Handling: Gracefully handles user input errors and displays appropriate error messages.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture
The architecture used in this project is [Android recommended architecture](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-architecture),
which I personally believe is a combination of some layers and principles of three architectures MVVM, MVI and Clean, which makes it great.
